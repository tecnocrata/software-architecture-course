# Arquitecto de Software

An expert developer who design software solutions from the ground up, making high-level decisions about each stage of the process including technical standards, tools, design principles, platforms to be used, etc., leading a team of engineers to create the final product.

## Niveles & Tipos de arquitectos

Architecture can be done on several “levels” of abstractions. The level influences the importance of necessary skills. As there are many categorizations possible my favorite segmentation includes these 3 levels:

- **Application Level:** The lowest level of architecture. Focus on one single application. Very detailed, low level design. Communication is usually within one development team.
- **Solution Level:** The mid-level of architecture. Focus on one or more applications which fulfill a business need (business solution). Some high, but mainly low-level design. Communication is between multiple development teams.
- **Enterprise Level:** The highest level of architecture. Focus on multiple solutions. High level, abstract design, which needs to be detailed out by solution or application architects. Communication is across the organization.

## Estilos de Arquitectura

- Microservices: where the system is built as a collection of small, independent, and loosely-coupled services.
- Event-Driven: where the system reacts to specific events that occur, rather than being continuously polled for changes.
- Layered: where the system is divided into a set of layers, each of which has a specific responsibility and communicates with the other layers through well-defined interfaces.
- Service-Oriented: where the system is built as a collection of services that can be accessed over a network.
- Data-Centric: where the system is focused on the storage, retrieval and manipulation of data, rather than the processing of data.
- Component-Based: where the system is composed of reusable and independent software components.
- Domain-Driven: where the system is organized around the core business domain and business entities.
